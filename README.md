This repository contains a lean boilerplate for rapidly developing fast, scalable, easy to maintain, strong-typed Umbraco websites. 

At the moment the codebase is there but I'm lacking a proper demo. I'll get round to it though as I am writing an accompanying set of articles.

Eventually there will be a Nuget package for consuming the library.

## Features

 - Three strong-typed Base-Class-Types Page, Component, NestedComponent
 - Strong-typed ContentHelper for document traversal.
 - Base Controllers, Views
 - Automatic mapping of Nested Content
 - Metadata and automatic XML sitemap generation
 - Language aware Metadata
 - All properties can be made language aware and map automatically
 - Faceted, language aware search engine with fragment highlighting

### Playing with the Solution

Having a play around is encouraged, I'm always looking for feedback.

The demo website login details are:
 - Username : zoombraco
 - Password : password
